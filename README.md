## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts the most suitable crop using soil and climate data.
- Recommends fertilizers based on nutrient deficiencies (N, P, K).
- Built with Python, scikit-learn, and pandas.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ§  Model Accuracy
- Crop Prediction Model: **95%+ accuracy** using Random Forest Classifier.
